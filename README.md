**Energy Consumption Forecasting & Pattern Recognition**

**Overview**

The goal of this project is to research the present intake patterns of energy in California's residential zone and forecast future power requirements. By utilizing information mining strategies and open statistics from Pacific Gas and Electricity (PG&E), the intention is to facilitate the transition to a sustainable future with the aid of optimizing energy utilization and figuring out abnormal consumption styles. The undertaking will focus on clustering techniques to know fashions for time series analysis and forecasting.
